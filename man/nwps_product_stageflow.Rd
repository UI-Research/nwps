\title{Get stage/flow product by PEDTS code}
\usage{
nwps_product_stageflow(identifier, pedts)
}
\arguments{
\item{identifier}{Character. Gauge LID (e.g., "PTTP1") or USGS ID.}

\item{pedts}{Character. SHEF PEDTS code specifying the data product
(e.g., "HGIRG" for observed stage, "HGIFF" for forecast stage).}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\describe{
\item{pedts}{SHEF Physical Element Data Type code}
\item{issued_time}{When the data was issued (POSIXct)}
\item{wfo}{Weather Forecast Office abbreviation}
\item{time_zone}{Time zone for the data}
\item{valid_time}{Observation/forecast valid time (POSIXct)}
\item{generated_time}{When the data point was generated (POSIXct)}
\item{primary}{Primary value (typically stage)}
\item{primary_name}{Name of primary measurement}
\item{primary_units}{Units for primary value}
\item{secondary}{Secondary value (typically flow)}
\item{secondary_name}{Name of secondary measurement}
\item{secondary_units}{Units for secondary value}
}
}
\description{
Retrieves stage/flow time series data for a specific SHEF Physical Element
Data Type Source (PEDTS) code. This provides more granular control over
which specific data product to retrieve compared to \code{nwps_gauge_stageflow()}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get observed stage data
observed <- nwps_product_stageflow("PTTP1", "HGIRG")

# Get forecast stage data
forecast <- nwps_product_stageflow("PTTP1", "HGIFF")
}
}
