\usage{
nwps_gauge_stageflow(identifier, product = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{identifier}{Character. Gauge LID (e.g., "PTTP1") or USGS ID.}

\item{product}{Character. Which product to retrieve: \code{"observed"},
\code{"forecast"}, or \code{NULL} (default) for both.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\describe{
\item{product}{Product type ("observed" or "forecast")}
\item{pedts}{SHEF Physical Element Data Type code}
\item{issued_time}{When the data was issued (POSIXct)}
\item{wfo}{Weather Forecast Office abbreviation}
\item{time_zone}{Time zone for the data}
\item{valid_time}{Observation/forecast valid time (POSIXct)}
\item{generated_time}{When the data point was generated (POSIXct)}
\item{primary}{Primary value (typically stage)}
\item{primary_name}{Name of primary measurement}
\item{primary_units}{Units for primary value}
\item{secondary}{Secondary value (typically flow)}
\item{secondary_name}{Name of secondary measurement}
\item{secondary_units}{Units for secondary value}
}
}
\description{
Retrieves observed and/or forecast stage and flow time series data for
a gauge.

# Get only observed data
observed <- nwps_gauge_stageflow("PTTP1", product = "observed")

# Get only forecast data
forecast <- nwps_gauge_stageflow("PTTP1", product = "forecast")
